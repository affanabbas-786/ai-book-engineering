title: Chapter 1 – Introduction to AI Book Engineering
---

Welcome to **AI Book Engineering: Spec-Driven Writing + RAG Chatbot Integration**.

This book is created as part of the **GIAIC AI / Spec-Driven Hackathon**. The goal is to show how we can use AI tools to:

- Plan and write a complete technical book using specs  
- Turn the book into a searchable knowledge base  
- Add an intelligent chatbot on top of the book content  
- Deploy everything as a live documentation website

## What Is AI Book Engineering?

AI Book Engineering is the process of using AI models and tools to:

- Design the structure of the book (chapters, sections, flows)  
- Generate draft content from specifications  
- Improve, refine, and polish that content  
- Connect the content to an interactive RAG chatbot

Instead of writing every page manually, we use **specifications + AI models** to build the book faster and with more consistency.

## Technologies Used in This Project

In this project we combine:

- **Claude Code + SpecKit Plus** for spec-driven writing  
- **Docusaurus** for the book website  
- **FastAPI** for backend APIs  
- **Qdrant Cloud** for vector storage and retrieval  
- **OpenAI ChatKit / Agents SDK** for building the chatbot  
- **Subagents and Skills** for reusable intelligence and bonus marks

## Who Is This Book For?

This book is for:

- GIAIC students participating in the hackathon  
- Beginners and intermediate learners of AI tooling  
- Anyone who wants to build AI-powered documentation and chatbots

By the end of the book, you should clearly understand the **end-to-end pipeline** from specs to live RAG-powered documentation.
