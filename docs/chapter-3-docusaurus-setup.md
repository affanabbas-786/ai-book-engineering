title: Chapter 3 – Building the Book with Docusaurus
---

Now that we have a plan for our content, we need a platform to host the book.  
For this project, we use **Docusaurus**, a popular static site generator for documentation.

## What Is Docusaurus?

Docusaurus is a framework that lets you:

- Write content in **Markdown**  
- Automatically generate a documentation website  
- Use a built-in sidebar and navigation  
- Deploy easily to **GitHub Pages** or other static hosts

It is perfect for technical books, docs, and tutorials.

## Creating the Docusaurus Project

From your chosen folder (for example, Desktop):

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest matrix-book classic
